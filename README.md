# Hardware Acceleration in solving ODE using Runge Kutta methods #

Hardware acceleration is crucial in enhancing performance, efficiency, and scalability across a wide range of computing applications. In this work, we have implemented a hardware accelerator specifically used for a Runge-Kutta Solver for solving an ordinary differential equation. The hardware accelerators have been implemented using the VHDL programming language and deployed on the Zynq ZC702 FPGA evaluation board. A comprehensive comparative analysis of different Runge-Kutta hardware accelerators, highlighting factors including timing performance, hardware resource usage, and the total on-chip power consumption has been given. According to the experimental findings, the fourth-order Runge-Kutta equation has a significant power consumption, rising by
an estimated 51.37 percent and 12.445 percent when comparing second-order and third-order Runge-Kutta solvers at a clock rate of 100 MHz, respectively. This
study contributes to the enhancement of ODE solutions in high-performance computing applications. This work has been published in **IEEE ICECCE 2023** conference. [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10442325]
